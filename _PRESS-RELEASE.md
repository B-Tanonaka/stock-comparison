# Stockr #

## Heading ##
 > A tool to compare the capital gains/losses of two stocks using a specified date and budget

## Sub-Heading ##
 > Stockr provides a dynamic graph that allows you to compare the daily closing price of two stocks

## Summary ##
 > This tool is for the visual investor. Inspired by Robinhood’s interactive graphs, Stockr allows you to see price fluctuations of two shares over time. It also provides the option to input a budget to determine how much you could have gained (or lost) if you invested that money on a certain day.

## Problem ##
 > Most stock comparison tools provide a plethora of metrics as rows in a spreadsheet that are difficult to comprehend for the everyday person.

## Solution ##
 > Stockr simplifies historical lookup by taking the closing price of each stock and laying them above one another on an interactive graph. The output is a single number representing capital gains/losses.

## Quote from You ##
 > I’ve used numerous brokerages and my biggest complaint is the lack of visual friendly methods to understand investing. While this tool is to be used as a for fun, hypothetical approach to thinking about future investments, I hope it makes it easier for some users to see how a stock moves overtime.

## How to Get Started ##
 > Select your starting date and input a budget; It currently defaults to January 01, 2023 and $5,000. Search for a stock using its ticker symbol and then do it again to see both at the same time. If you want to remove a stock, click on its name.

## Customer Quote ##
 > “I recently started investing and quickly became overwhelmed with where I should be putting my money. As a visual person it was easy for me to plug in two of my favorite companies and see how rich I could have been."

## Closing and Call to Action
 > This tool will continue to be updated with new features. Some things in the works is the graph showing day by day gains/losses, currency converter, and comparing more than two stocks. Stay tuned.

## Warning ##
 > I am not a financial advisor and this tool is only used to see past performance. It is not indicative of potential future gains.
